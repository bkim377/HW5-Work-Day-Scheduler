# HW5-Work-Day-Scheduler
A README containing my HW5 submission.  Has a description, link to the deployed application, and a screenshot.

1) Description: a daily schedulr planner that gives the current date and time, as well as rows of timeblocks from 9am to 5pm.  The rows change color based on what the current hour is, and the user can input text and save them to localStorage.  The only part I was not able to figure out was the persistent text after page refreshing, but the user should still be able to open the Chrome console and retrieve the localStorage values manually.

2) Deployed application: https://bkim377.github.io/HW5-Work-Day-Scheduler/
